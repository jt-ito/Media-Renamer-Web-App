Checkpoint: Dashboard checkbox gutter layout
Date: 2025-08-17
Summary:
- Rendered absolute-positioned left gutter (56px) with checkbox per item.
- Card is shifted right via marginLeft:56 so it doesn't drop below the gutter.
- Spacer added to align checkboxes with card header.
- Item rows modified to have minHeight 56 and marginBottom 8.
Files touched:
- web/src/components/Dashboard.tsx (gutter + renderLibraryCard changes)
Next action taken after checkpoint:
- Adjusted item row vertical alignment from "items-start" to "items-center" to center content vertically so checkboxes align with the middle of each entry.

This is an automated checkpoint saved before further layout iterations.
